NSbench
-------

NSbench is a collection of Python scripts based on FEniCS/DOLFIN for
benchmarking a number of common methods for solving the incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations.

NSbench uses DOLFIN and requires DOLFIN 1.0 (www.fenicsproject.org).

It consists of a collection of test problems and a collection of
reference/prototype solvers. Problem implementations can be found in
the 'problem' directory and solver implementations can be found in the
'solver' directory.

Two main scripts are provided for running the solvers: 'ns' and 'bench'.

The script 'ns' can be used to solve a specific problem with a specific
solver:

  ./ns problem solver

Without any arguments, the 'ns' script will list available problems
and solvers.

The script 'bench' can be used to run all problems for all solvers,
one specific problem for all solvers, or one specific solver for all
problems:

  ./bench
  ./bench problem
  ./bench solver

Results (errors and CPU time) will be stored in the 'results'
subdirectory. Use the 'plot' script to extract and plot results
from running the benchmarks.
